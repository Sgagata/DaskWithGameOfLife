    "This assignment used the initial, synchronous implementation of the game of life from one of the earlier tutorials as a base. The code was adapted for dask, and the result was analysed between various parameters and computation methods. Furthermore, an alternative implementation of the game of life is presented. The alternative version uses convolve from Scipy to get the number of the cell's neighbours. The data used for the analysis comes from the files 1000x1000.0.1 and 10000x10000.0.2. "
